1. In an incident at GITHUB, an out of date MySQL follower was promoted as leader. The database used an auto-incrementing counter to assign primary keys to new rows but since the new follower was lagging behind, it generated primary keys that were previously assigned. Since caching mechanism was used, REDIS cache also had those primary keys. So redis exposed data of previous users who had those keys.
