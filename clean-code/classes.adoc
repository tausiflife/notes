* A class should begin with a list of variables.
** Public static constants, if any, should come first.
** Then private static variables,
** followed by private instance variables.
** Public functions should follow the list of variables.
** Put the private utilities called by a public function right after the public function itself.

* Have a *_concise name_* of the class. More ambiguous the name more likely that it has too many responsibilities.
Avoid names like _Processor_, _Manager_, _Super_ in the class.
