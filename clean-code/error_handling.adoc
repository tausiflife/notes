* Try to write tests that force exceptions, and then add behavior to your handler to satisfy your tests. This will
cause you to build the transaction scope of the try block first and will help you maintain the transaction nature of
that scope.
** Not a good code
[source, java]
public List<RecordedGrip> retrieveSection(String sectionName) {
try {
    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(sectionName);
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new StorageException("retrieval error", e);
}
return new ArrayList<RecordedGrip>();
}

** Good code
[source, java]
public List<RecordedGrip> retrieveSection(String sectionName) {
try {
    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(sectionName);
    stream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    throw new StorageException("retrieval error", e);
}
return new ArrayList<RecordedGrip>();
}

* *_Checked exceptions violate Open/Closed Principle_*. If you throw a checked exception from a method
in your code and the catch is three levels above, you must declare that exception in the signature of each method
between you and the catch. This means that a change at a low level of the software can force signature changes on many
higher levels. The changed modules must be rebuilt and redeployed, even though nothing they care about changed.

* Wrapping third-party APIs is a best practice. When you wrap a third-party API, you minimize your dependencies
upon it. You can choose to move to a different library in the future without much penalty.

* Wrapping also makes it easier to mock out third-party calls when you are testing your own code.
* With wrapping, you aren't tied to a particular vendorâ€™s API design choices. You can define an API that you feel
comfortable with.

** Dependency on external API
[source, java]
ACMEPort port = new ACMEPort(12);
try {
    port.open();
} catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
    reportPortError(e);
    logger.log("Device response exception", e);
} catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
    reportPortError(e);
    logger.log("Unlock exception", e);
} catch (GMXError e) {
    reportPortError(e);
    logger.log("Device response exception");
} finally {
}

** Your choice
[source, java]
LocalPort port = new LocalPort(12);
try {
    port.open();
} catch (PortDeviceFailure e) {
    reportError(e);
    logger.log(e.getMessage(), e);
} finally {
...
}
public class LocalPort {
    private ACMEPort innerPort;
    public LocalPort(int portNumber) {
        innerPort = new ACMEPort(portNumber);
    }
    public void open() {
        try {
            innerPort.open();
        } catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
            throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
        } catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
            throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
        } catch (GMXError e) {
            throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
        }
    }
}

* Don't return *_null_* objects. If you are tempted to return null from a method, consider throwing an exception or
returning a SPECIAL CASE object instead.

* If you are calling a null-returning method from a third-party API, consider wrapping that method with a method that
either throws an exception or returns a special case object.
