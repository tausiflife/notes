* Try _not_ to _expose details_ of your data, rather _express_ it  in _abstract terms_. Merely adding interface or/and
getters and setters is not good.
* *_Objects hide_* their *_data_* behind *_abstractions_* and *_expose functions_* that operate on that data. *_Data
structure expose_* their *_data_* and have *_no meaningful functions_*.
* *_Law of Demeter_* says that a *_method f_* of a *_class C_* should only call the methods of these:
** C
** An object created by f
** An object passed as an argument to f
** An object held in an instance variable of C
** The below code violates the law
[source, java]
final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();

** However this code doesn't
[source, java]
Options opts = ctxt.getOptions();
File scratchDir = opts.getScratchDir();
final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();
final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();
