* Four simple rules to follow making good designs -
** Runs all tests.
** Contains no duplication - refactoring
** Expresses the intent of the programmer.
** Minimizes the number of classes and methods.

=== Run all tests
* System should be testable and verifiable.

==== Duplication
* Duplication is the primary enemy of well designed systems.
** We could use a boolean for isEmpty and size for the counter.
[source ,java]
int size() {
    return this.size;
}
boolean isEmpty() {
    return this.empty;
}

** Or we can implement both using just the size.
[source, java]
int size() {
    return this.size;
}
boolean isEmpty() {
    return this.size == 0;
}
