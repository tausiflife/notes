* The tests and the production code are written together, with the tests just a few seconds ahead of the production code.

* Use the *_BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK_* pattern.

* Every test function in a JUnit test should have *_one and only one assert_* statement.

* Clean tests follow five other rules: *_F.I.R.S.T_*
** __F__ast - run fast
** __I__ndependent - not dependent on any other test
** __R__epeatable - repeatable in any environment.
** __S__elf validating - boolean output, they either pass or fail
** __T__imely - should be written just before the production code.
