* Myths of concurrency -
** Concurrency always improves performance.
** Design does not change when writing concurrent programs.
** Understanding concurrency issues is not important when working with a container such as a Web or EJB container.

* Balanced concerns while writing concurrent software -
** Concurrency incurs some overhead, both in performance as well as writing additional code.
** Correct concurrency is complex, even for simple problems.
** Concurrency bugs arenâ€™t usually repeatable, so they are often ignored as one-offs2 instead of the true defects they
are.
** Concurrency often requires a fundamental change in design strategy.

* Recommendations for concurrency -
** Keep your concurrency-related code separate from other code.
** Take data encapsulation to heart; severely limit the access of any data that may be shared.
** Copies of data can be used, but that will cost extra for object creation, however the savings in avoiding intrinsic
locks will likely makeup.
** Consider writing your threaded code such that each thread exists in its own world, sharing no data with any other
thread. This makes each of those threads behave as if it were the only thread in the world and there were no
synchronization requirements.
** Review the classes available to you. In the case of Java, become familiar with java.util.concurrent,
java.util.concurrent.atomic, java.util.concurrent.locks.

// A lock that can be acquired in one method and released in another.
ReentrantLock.java
// An implementation of the classic semaphore, a lock with a count.
Semaphore.java
/* A lock that waits for a number of events before releasing all threads waiting on it. This allows all threads to have
a fair chance of starting at about the same time.*/
CountDownLatch.java

** Avoid using more than one method on a shared object.
