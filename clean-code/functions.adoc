* Functions should be as *_small_* as possible.
* Should *_not_* be large enough to *_hold nested structures_*, and hence *_indent level shouldn't be more than 1 or 2_*.
* It *_should do one thing_*. How to find if the function is doing one thing -
** It does only those steps that are one level below the stated name of the function.
** You shouldn't be able to extract another function that is not a replica or very similar to the implementation.
** One level of abstraction per function.
* *_The step down rule_* - All functions should be have smaller function which are at next level of abstraction, so you
are descending one level of abstraction at a time.
* When using *_switch statements_*, make sure they are buried deep down *_in a low level class_* and never repeated,
*_using polymorphism_*.
* Choose *_good names_* for *_smaller functions_* that do *_one thing_*. Don't be afraid to make long descriptive names.
* Function arguments :
** Ideal number of arguments = 1, at most 3.
** *Monadic functions*: Two very common reasons to pass single argument are -
*** Asking a question about the argument.
*** Transforming it into something else and returning it.
*** Used as an event, with function returning now return value. Instead it uses the argument to change the state of the system.
*** Flag arguments are bad. They mean that the function is doing more than one thing depending on the flag.
** *Dyadic functions* : 2 arguments. To be used when ordered components of a single value, natural cohesion and natural ordering.
* If you have *_side effects_* in the function, those must be *_mentioned in the name_* of the function.
* *_Output arguments_* should be avoided. If the function must change something, make it change the state of the onwing object.
* Command and query separation - A function should either do something or answer something. Not both.
* Prefer *_exception_* to returning *_error codes_*.
* Extract the *_body_* of *_try and catch_* into *_functions_* of their *_own_*.
* If *_try_* exists in a function, it should be the *_first word_* and *_nothing_* after *_catch/finally_*.
* *_Variables_* should be declared as *_close to the usage_* as possible.
* *_Control variables_* should be declared *_within the loop_* statement.
* *_Dependent function_* : If one function calls another they should be vertically close with *_caller above callee_*.
* *_Conceptual affinity_* : Functions should be close which are
** Calling one another.
** Using a variable.
** Group of functions performing similar function.
